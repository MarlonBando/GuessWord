# GuessWord
GuessWord is a peer-to-peer game that I developed using the React.js framework. The goal of the game is to guess a word based on its initials, and as time passes, more letters of the word are gradually revealed. The game is designed to be fast-paced and challenging, with players racing against the clock to see who can guess the word correctly first. The game's user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for players of all ages to enjoy. Overall, GuessWord is a fun and engaging game that is perfect for anyone looking for a quick and exciting challenge.
